				<h3>Introduction</h3>
				Paradox is a facility to execute SQL query on data stored in NoSQL
				database. <br> SQL or Structured Query Language is common to
				all relational database. Relational database requires <em>schema</em>
				or information about structure of records <em>before</em> storing
				them. Hence it is possible for a relational database engine to query
				the data i.e to evaluate the records by certain criteria on their
				content.
				<p>
					NoSQL databases are different. One difference is they can write
					data <em>without</em> a schema. Hence, the structure of data is
					often <em>opaque</em> to a NoSQL database.
				<p>
					The <em>opaque</em> nature makes it infeasible for a NoSQL database
					to support query. The applications using NoSQL database reads <em>opaque</em>
					data and have to interpret them. Paradox enables such applications
					to evaluate SQL query on data.
				<h3>Quick Example</h3>

				<h3>Key-Value Store</h3>
				Key-Value store is a category of NoSQL databases. A Key-Value
				database stores each record with a unique key. The application must
				supply unique key for each record. The application later can
				retrieve the record by the key.
				<h4>Oracle NoSQL Key-Value Store</h4>
				Oracle provides a NoSQL Key-Value store with added features <br>
				<ul>
					<li>Distributed Storage: Data records are stored in multiple
						disks. Multiple copies of same data record are maintained.
					<li>Transaction: Under certain conditions, database provides
						transaction warranty.
				</ul>

				Paradox currently works with Oracle NoSQL Key-Value store. But
				Paradox is designed to work with other Key-Value stores such as
				Riak, MongoDB or Cassandra.

				<h3>Application</h3>
				Two essential information to execute SQL query on a Key-Value store
				<ol>
					<li>how to form a key to access a record
					<li>how to extract the value of a named property from a record
					
				</ol>

				Ideally, an application can supply these essential information.
				Paradox can be configured to use such information via a defined
				interface. However, Paradox defaults to following in absence of such
				specification by the application
				<ol>
					<li>Key Policy: performs a full scan i.e evaluates each record
					
					<li>Value Policy: assumes stored records are encoded in JSON
						so value of a named property can be extracted.
				</ol>

				A Key Policy, when specified by the application, helps to narrow a
				the candidate extent. <br> Whereas a Value Policy helps to
				query records taht are <em>not</em> encoded in JSON. extent.


				<h3>SQL</h3>
				A typical SQL in Paradox is quite similar to standard SQL:
				<pre>
					<code>
 select * from Person where name='John' order by age DESC
 </code>
				</pre>

				<h4>Synatx Difference</h4>
				Paradox differs from SQL syntax in JOIN operation. <br> A
				Key-Value database maintains each data independently of any other
				i.e it is non-relational. Hence a JOIN, a relational operation, is
				expressed in navigation syntax (more like OQL or JPQL). <br>
				For example to find all Persons with address in city of San
				Francisco, a Paradox SQL will be: <br>
				<pre>
					<code>
 select * from Person where address.city='San Francisco'
 </code>
				</pre>
				whereas a relational SQL would be:
				<pre>
					<code>
 select * from Person JOIN Address where Person.id=Address.owner_id AND Address.city='San Francisco'
 </code>
				</pre>
