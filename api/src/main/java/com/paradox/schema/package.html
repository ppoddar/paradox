Interfaces for Schema or a Type system. 
<br>
These definitions describe a type system that can be stored in a database. 
Hence, type definition can have constraints on attribute(s) to form primary key, or  
secondary index.   

<ul>
<li>Schema is a <em>group</em> of related Types.
<li>Types are categorized as: Primitive, Enumerated, Container and User-defined 
<li>Each user-defined type has zero or more named attributes
<li>Each Attribute is of certain type that determines what value can be held in that attribute. 
<li>Constraints are set on one or more attribute
to qualify or restrict whether it is indexed, its cardinality or whether it allows null values etc.
<li>Schema imposes a closure on the types. The type of each attribute is also a type contained in the same schema.
</ul>
