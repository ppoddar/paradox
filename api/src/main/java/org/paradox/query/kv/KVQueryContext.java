/**
 * A context provides an environment to execute a query.
 * <br>
 * A query execution on a Key-Value store requires few associated artifacts
 * that the user of this interface must supply:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link KeyMaker} to create a partial or complete {@link Key}. 
 * For key-value store, the composition of key is designed by the application  
 * and hence the {@link KeyMaker} contract can only be satisfied by the application.
 * <li>{@link ValueTransformer} to extract the property from the value.    
 * The storage representation is opaque (an array of bytes). The query expressions 
 * based on property value e.g. {@code person.age > 25} can not be evaluated unless 
 * the user representation is known. 
 * <li>{@link Schema} to validate the query semantically. The schema can be optional.
 * If a schema is supplied, then the name tokens in a query are validated against 
 * the schema namespace.  
 * {@link Consistency} read consistency. It is defaulted to {@link Consistency#NONE_REQUIRED}.
 * <li>and last, but not the least, {@link KVStore Store} reference.  
 * <li>which is the representation for the output/selected result?
 * </ul>
 * This interface pulls together these concerns.
 * <p>
 * <b>Bind Parameter</b>: If a query using bind parameters (it is recommended), then the     
 * 
 * <K> type of key used by the data store
 * <V> type of representation for values used by the data store
 * <U> type of representation for values used by the user application
